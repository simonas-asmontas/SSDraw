# SSDraw

This SSDraw version was forked from https://github.com/ncbi/SSDraw to introduce minor source code changes aimed to enable clearer drawing of aligned proteins with the possibility to color them using a AlphaFold pLDDT palette.
This custom version of SSDraw is not tailored to be used by external users, however feel free to copy the new code elements, introduced in this fork, should you make your own customized version of the original SSDraw.
